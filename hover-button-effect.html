        <h1>EGYPT</h1>
        <p>
          Egypt, a country linking northeast Africa with the Middle East, dates
          to the time of the pharaohs. Millennia-old monuments sit along the
          fertile Nile River Valley, including Giza's colossal Pyramids and
          Great Sphinx as well as Luxor's hieroglyph-lined Karnak Temple and
          Valley of the Kings tombs. The capital, Cairo, is home to Ottoman
          landmarks like Muhammad Ali Mosque and the Egyptian Museum, a trove of
          antiquities.
